It's based on the old UTM-30LX laser so that means it has an effective range of 30m and 270 degrees. The only differences with the previous model are:<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Ethernet connection instead of USB</li><li>Multi-echo functionality, very helpful for outdoors</li></ul><div>Anyway since it's a fairly new laser, I couldn't find any drivers or API to use with matlab. So I decided to write my own. It's very simple and the only thing it does is initialize a connection to the laser and then starts grabbing the data. It also incorporates decoding and error detection functions. The code runs at almost 40hz. You can find it uploaded at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37613-hokuyo-utm-30-lx-ew-for-matlab" target="_blank">mathworks file exchange</a>.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE:</b><br />My friend Ana form KIT has upgraded the API with the capability to also return intensities and multi-echo data.
